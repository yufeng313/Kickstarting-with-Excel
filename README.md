# Kickstarting-with-Excel
## Visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals
### In this challenge, we'll help Louise to find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    1 In the Kickstarter_Challenge.xlsx workbook,  I created a new column labeled "Years". And use the YEAR() function to extract the year from the “Date Created Conversion” column.
    2 Create a pivot table from the KickStarter worksheet, and place the pivot table in a new sheet.
    3 Drag "outcomes" to the Legend(Series), and drag "Data Created Conversion" to the Axis(Categories),and then drag "outcomes" to the Values.Filter the pivot table based on "Parent Category" and "Years."
    Here is the pivot table and pivot chart:![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107179765/173181288-0d186b25-9a7c-4a31-bb88-6d91eb5ef12c.png)
